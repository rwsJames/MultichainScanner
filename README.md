# MultichainScanner
This is my first substantial attempt at creating an easily configurable multichain liquidity pool/price scanner. As such, refinement and support for this project will be slim to none as I have already moved on to creating the new one. 

Some of my own non-critical API keys are made visible here in an attempt to make setup configuration clear (and I can give no guarantee that the API keys provided will continue to work out of the box).  This currently only works for RPCs that use a RESTful API and that use etherscan's parameters.

I'm sure most of the issues with this project, such as the redundancy in tokens, lack of a configurable target, settings, etc. will be remedied in the new scanner, built to be much more configurable, extensible (in terms of code extensibility), expansive (allowing use of the request body for GraphQL), and efficient.

Happy arb'ing!
